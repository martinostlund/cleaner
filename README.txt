The goal of this project is to create a helper function that will clean (sanitize) any HTML formatted text 
and make it safe for output in a javascript-enabled web browser. The basic concept is to 
remove anything that is not explicitly allowed (as opposed to specify what is not allowed). The script is configured by supplying which tags are allowed and which attributes are allowed for those tags. Any other content is stripped.
